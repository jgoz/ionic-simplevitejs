Simple Ionic 6 + ViteJS + Jest app
==================================

This branch contains a simple React application that uses ViteJS template, Ionic 5.9.1, and Jest.

Running Jest in this branch succeeds:

```sh
git checkout jest-ionic5
yarn run test
# => ... Tests: 1 passed, 1 total...
```

See branch `jest-ionic6` for what happens when Ionic is upgraded to 6.0.0 (RC3) -- Jest starts failing (with no other changes).
